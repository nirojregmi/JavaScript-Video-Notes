# A1 task: Beginner’s Series to JavaScript
JavaScript is a programming language to interact with elements on a webpage in a browser like adding a button aor changing a style with code it is a c base language so it kind of looks like java but it nothing to do with java . it is a dynamically typed language. It is the most used programming language in the world huge websites and social media sites uses java script. Its in the browser you can built application with the java script. You can use java script in any platform to built any product. It has unlimited use cases. 
## Java script--Client vs server
- Java script on client-  a web browser put the file in a separate file with .js extension use same script tag but you gonna specify with a src attribute and point it to the script file called source file
To run java script on a server side we need to use node.js. we have to install node.js on the server side and execute by calling node and the script file directly from the command line. Repository of third party packages called npm which contains package of anything we can think of.
Webbrower uses script tags primarily used for building user interfaces  and server uses node.js to be installed and is usually used for buildingweb services.
## Learnt to install vsc and node.js in video 4 and 5
## Learnt the use cases for single quotes, double quote ,%S, $, back tick
## Building a first java script application using node.js. making different folders with files that contains file. Use of single quotes and double quotes.
Code comments in java script are the lines in the code that we can see but doesnot execute
Two types of comment single line and multi lilne comment  //
Multi line comment /*abcde*/
Demo comments: ToDo list could be created so we can come back and do the job.
Ctrl + / it comments a line out and if selected a block it comments the whole block.
## Declaring variables:  three ways
 Var one = 1;  fuction scoped, can be changed in scope, available before declaration.
Let two =2;  block scoped, can be changed in scope, only available after declaration.
Const three = 3; Block scoped. Like let, cannot be changed, only available after declaration.
Demo of declaration of variables: learnt different use case of different varriables (var,let and const).
## Working with strings: string concatenation combines two or more strings, it helps to make test easier to format. It can join a combination of variables and/or actual string called string literals. Concatenation strings will make a new string. Strings are closed with quotes. 
Demo working with string: Learnt the use case of (+) operator. Both number and string uses + operator.

## Using template literals to format string: uses one pair of baclticks, respects line breaks, placeholders insert variable values and expressions.
Template literals demo: concatenation, string, Boolean use cases

## Data type in java script: 
simple type: number, string, Boolean, date, function, array and object
 special type: NaN, null, undefined

## Double equal operator and triple equal operator == and use (===) for type testing.
demo: different use cases of array, number, string, Boolean, object and function.
Math in javascript: addition, substraction, multiplication and division. Increase or decrease a number by 1 (++num19 (--num1) use case of math object for performing trigonometric, logarithmic and other more. 
Demo: basic math operation and use case of math object.
## Converting string to numbers: use case of parseInt()  and 
parseFloat() for floating point numbers, numbers with decimal points.
toString() to convert numbers to numerical strings.
## Video 20
- Converting strings to numbers:  use case of parseInt function with strings. Use case of Template Literals and numbers to string.
parseInt()  for whole numbers 
ParseFloat() for decimals
## Video 21 & 22
- Handling errors with try/catch/finally: 
Exception: Interruption in the inteded execution of code.
Error: Unintended interruption in execution of code.
Throwing an Exception: sending a message that something has gone wrong in the intended execution of code. It can be thrown by javascript or manually.
Uncaught Exceptions:  
Try (Block of code that may throw an exception)
Catch (Block of code that will run if an exception is thrown)
Finally (optional enclosed part of code that will run after the try block or after the catch block)
Demo handling errors: usnig two different exception. String and Boolean.
Throwing (Try..Catch..Finally) exceptions
